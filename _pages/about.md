I am an evolutionary biologist and population geneticist based at Uppsala University in Sweden. Using next generation sequencing techniques, I study the genetic basis of local adaptation in non-model species (ü¶ú + üêü). My research interests predominantly centre around understanding how populations respond to environmental change, with a particular interest in the genetic and phenotypic changes that take place during the first few generations following the colonisation of new environments.

Jag √§r en evolutionsbiolog och populationsgenetiker baserad p√• Uppsala universitet i Sverige. Anv√§nder sig av n√§sta generations sekvenseringstekniker studerar jag den genetiska grunden f√∂r lokal anpassning hos icke-modellarter. Mina forskningsintressen √§r inriktade att f√∂rst√• hur befolkningar reagerar p√• milj√∂f√∂r√§ndringar, med ett s√§rskilt intresse f√∂r de genetika och fenotypisk f√∂r√§ndringar som sker under f√∂rsta generationerna efter koloniseringen av nya milj√∂er.

**Avian introductions as a means of studying incipient divergence**

The study of island-colonising birds has played a pivotal role in the development of evolutionary theory ever since Charles Darwin‚Äôs observations of finches in the Gal√°pagos and Alfred Wallace‚Äôs work on the birds of the Malay Archipelago informed their co-discovery of natural selection. However, as contemporary island-colonisations are rare, evolutionary insights into the very early stages of divergence have been predominantly retrospective ‚Äì past processes are inferred from the vantage point of the present. This approach has been referred to as the ‚Äòspyglass‚Äô as processes are studied long after they have taken place. However, as past processes cannot be seen clearly through the veil of time, the spyglass approach is unlikely to reveal much about the initial changes that take place following the establishment of new populations, leaving many important evolutionary questions un-answered. Such questions include: Do changes early on in the divergence process constrain the evolutionary trajectory of a population? and Why do some species succeed in establishing new populations, but others fail? Using recent, human-mediated introductions of birds to the islands of French Polynesia, and subsequent natural colonisations within the region, I am addressing these questions by inferring the changes that characterise incipient divergence from more recent and clearer vantage points.

**How to build a dodo: The genetic basis of the island syndrome**

*Collaboration with Sonya Clegg, Andrea Estandia and Micha≈Ç Jezierski*

The Dodo provides an extreme example of an evolutionary journey that continues to play out to different extents in island bird species across the globe; a suite of changes referred to as the ‚Äòisland syndrome‚Äô. Common changes include initially small species evolving larger body size (and vice versa), reduced dispersal capacity, increased tameness, and a slowed pace of life (longer-lived with slower reproduction). It is thought that the syndrome ultimately extends from exposure to a common suite of biotic conditions on islands; a combination of reduced predation, and shift in the balance of within- versus between-species competition, features that fundamentally change the selective pressures in predictable ways. How are these changes manifested at the genetic level? Are island syndrome characteristics achieved via selection at the same or different genes? By focusing on a group of island-colonising birds, the south Pacific silvereyes (*Zosterops lateralis*), that display varying degrees of island syndrome characteristics, including larger body size, increased tameness and slower life history, depending on the time since colonisation we aim to elucidate the genetic mechanisms that underpin the widespread evolutionary phenomenon of the island syndrome.
